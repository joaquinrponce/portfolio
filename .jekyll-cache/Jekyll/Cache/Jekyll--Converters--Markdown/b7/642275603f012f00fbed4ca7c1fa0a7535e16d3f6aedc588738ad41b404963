<div class="about">
My name is **Joaqu√≠n Ponce**. I'm based in Mexico.

I started learning web development in January 2020 through TheOdinProject. It wasn't my first incursion into coding - while I didn't really know any language to a decent extent, I had used Lua before for scripting some content in a videogame. I also used to enjoy creating WeakAuras for World of Warcraft. I've always had interest in coding, but hadn't really taken it seriously.

I try to learn something new whenever I start a new project. For me, learning is important and enjoyable, and seeing the results of it is very satisfying. I'm also quite competitive, and like pushing myself to do the best I can with my current skills.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually playing videogames, or learning about coding. Besides web development, I'm particularly interested in game coding, and that is usually the subject of my research.
