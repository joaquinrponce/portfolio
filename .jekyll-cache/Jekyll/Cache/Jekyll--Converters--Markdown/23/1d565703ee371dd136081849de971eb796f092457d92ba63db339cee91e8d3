<p>A tribute to a minigame found in Super Mario 64 DS and New Super Mario Bros., called “Sort or ‘Splode”. Gameplay is simple: drag red bombs to the red square and grey bombs to the grey square before they explode. Dragging them to the wrong square results in losing the game!</p>

<p>This was a fun project made fully in <strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>. It can be played on desktop with a mouse and also on touchscreen devices, and resizes itself to match the viewport if played on the live page.</p>
