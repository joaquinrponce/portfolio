<div class="about">
  <p>My name is <strong>JoaquÃ­n Ponce</strong>. Iâ€™m based in Mexico and Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer.</p>

  <p>I started learning web development in January 2020 through TheOdinProject. While Iâ€™d always been interesting in coding, until then I hadnâ€™t really delved into it. I had some exposure to coding in a couple videogames that used Lua for scripting, but I didnâ€™t learn much outside of their own small domains.</p>

  <p>I try to learn something new whenever I start a new project. For me, learning is important and enjoyable, and seeing the results of it is very satisfying. Iâ€™m also quite competitive, and like pushing myself to do the best I can with my current skills.</p>

  <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually playing videogames, or learning about coding. Besides web development, Iâ€™m particularly interested in game coding, and either of those subjects are usually what I research about.</p>
