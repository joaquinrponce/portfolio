I"Ã<h1 id="me">Me</h1>

<p>My name is <strong>JoaquÃ­n Ponce</strong>. Iâ€™m based in Mexico.</p>

<p>I started learning web development in January 2020 through TheOdinProject. It wasnâ€™t my first incursion into coding - while I didnâ€™t really know any language to a decent extent, I had used Lua before for scripting some content in a videogame. I also used to enjoy creating WeakAuras for World of Warcraft. Iâ€™ve always had interest in coding, but hadnâ€™t really taken it seriously.</p>

<p>I try to learn something new whenever I start a new project. For me, learning is important and enjoyable, and seeing the results of it is very satisfying. Iâ€™m also quite competitive, and like pushing myself to do the best I can with my current skills.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually playing videogames, or learning about coding. Besides web development, Iâ€™m particularly interested in game coding, and that is usually the subject of my research.</p>
