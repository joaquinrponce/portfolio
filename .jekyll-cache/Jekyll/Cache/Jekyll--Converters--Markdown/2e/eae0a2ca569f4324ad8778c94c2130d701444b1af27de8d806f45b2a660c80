<div class="about">
  <p>My name is <strong>JoaquÃ­n Ponce</strong>. Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer based in Mexico.</p>

  <p>I enjoy creating websites, be it front or back-end. My motivation comes from problem-solving and a passion for learning, as well as teaching others the knowledge I myself have learned. Currently, Iâ€™m invested in learning and utilizing React and Rails.</p>

  <p>When not coding, Iâ€™m learning about coding. And when not learning, Iâ€™m usually playing videogames.</p>

  <p>You can find me on:</p>
