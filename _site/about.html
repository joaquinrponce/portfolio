<div class="about">

  <p>Hello there. I’m Joaquín.</p>

  <p>I began learning web development in January 2020. I was always interested in learning to code, but it wasn’t until then that I decided to take on learning it seriously.</p>

  <p>I enjoy creating websites, be it front or back-end. My motivation comes from problem-solving and a passion for learning, as well as teaching others the knowledge I myself have learned. Currently, I’m invested in learning and utilizing React and Rails.</p>

  <p>When not coding, I’m learning about coding. And when not learning, I’m usually playing videogames.</p>
