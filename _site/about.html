<div class="about">
  <p>My name is <strong>Joaquín Ponce</strong>. I’m based in Mexico.</p>

  <p>I started learning web development in January 2020 through TheOdinProject. It wasn’t my first incursion into coding - while I didn’t really know any language to a decent extent, I had used Lua before for scripting some content in a videogame. I also used to enjoy creating WeakAuras for World of Warcraft. I’ve always had interest in coding, but hadn’t really taken it seriously.</p>

  <p>I try to learn something new whenever I start a new project. For me, learning is important and enjoyable, and seeing the results of it is very satisfying. I’m also quite competitive, and like pushing myself to do the best I can with my current skills.</p>

  <p>When I’m not coding, I’m usually playing videogames, or learning about coding. Besides web development, I’m particularly interested in game coding, and that is usually the subject of my research.</p>

  <p>You can find me on:</p>
