An interactive **Conway's Game of Life**. You can draw on it, clear it and randomize it, and make it crazy colors if you want to. Initially, it was made with Canvas, but I found CSS grid to be more aesthetically pleasing, and also allowing for easier manipulation of colors. All made with vanilla JavaScript.
