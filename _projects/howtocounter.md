A web app that displays detailed information on units from the videogame Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition. With the complexity of unit matchups in the game, the app aims to provide information how well a particular unit fares against others.

Made with a **React front-end** and a **Rails back-end**, implementing **ActiveAdmin** for easy access to databse entries and allowing many people to contribute with the right permissions.
