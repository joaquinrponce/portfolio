A small project I'm working on, integrating **React** on the front end with a **Rails back-end**, communicating through **ActionCable websockets**.

It is very simple and allows for multiple users to stream from the same channel (a chat room) at the same time. Mostly done as an introduction to websockets from a Rails standpoint. Eventually, the ability to be in multiple rooms at once, limiting the amount of people in a room, and room password may be added.
