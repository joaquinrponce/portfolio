A **Reddit** clone made with a **React front-end** and a **Rails API back-end**. It implements most of Reddit's features, including text/image/url posts, comments, nested comments, upvoting and downvotings, creating and modifying subreddits, subscribing and unsubscribing, a custom feed from subscribed subreddits, and user profiles.
